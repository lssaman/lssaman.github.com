        <!--Write some words about yourself in the p tags-->
        <p> Here is a little about myself. </P>
        <P> I will be graduating in the Spring with three Bachelor Degrees: </P>
          <ul>
            <li> Creative Writing </li>
            <li> Professional Writing </li>
            <li> Human Development </li>
          </ul>

      <!--  <p> I started out in the English field because writing and reading are the two things I love to do the most. After a year of that, however, I began to wonder what I would do with my life with this as my degree, so I began searching, and I found the Human Development major. I started volunteering at a crisis hotline, because I wanted to work on my social confidence, and I fell in love with helping people find their reason for wanting to continue living. I still want to be a publish author, but my career path is going towards mental health clinical counselling now. I spend a lot of my time focuses on suicide prevention. I am very active in To Write Love on Her Arms (TWLOHA) and Active Minds and working with RAFT Crisis Hotline of the NRV area. I am not too worried about this course, as I have spent a lot of time working with HTML already. I am fairly confident that I will do well in this course. I am excited to learn about anything you can give me. </p>

        <h2> RAFT Crisis Hotline </h2>
          <p> RAFT is a Crisis Hotline that is in the NRV area of Virginia. I have been volunteering here for two years now, and I am more motivated than ever to have spread the word of what they do because this is the cause that has motivated my own mental health successes. The RAFT Crisis Hotline is a program of NRVCS (New River Valley Community Services) that offers free paraprofessional phone counseling services to the community. The volunteers here provide suicide and crisis intervention, empathy and support, mental health and substance abuse information and referrals to the counties of Montgomery, Floyd, Giles, Pulaski and the City of Radford (including Virginia Tech and Radford University). There is no audience that can't fit into these services. We help all! What I want from this is for other to see the expansive help that is out there for them. You are not alone in your struggles. We are here to stand with you and be your shoulder to cry on.
